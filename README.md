# Poincare Excercise

This as a tensor excercise in Maxima CAS 
(Computer Algebra System).

Poincare-metric (time axis treated as imaginary value,
space axis as real values) 
used instead of Minkowski-metric,
and verified with the same example from
[Lorentz transformation - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_transformation)
that both metrics provide the same transformations.

In the excercise, an arbitrary observer speed can
be entered (either subluminal or superluminal) and 
Lorentz transformations will be applied to the 
4-vector of timespace coordinates, electromagnetic
field tensor, and density of charge and current.
